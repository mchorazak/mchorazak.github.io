								<h2>Music</h2>
								<p>
								<br>
									Music was a big part of my education, and even when school has finished, it is still a big part of my life, as a hobby. </br>
									I think it's big enough to get a separate paragraph.
                                </p>

									I spent 10 years learning how to play clarinet.
									I did not pursue carreer in this field because I did not feel in love with the instrument.
									However, everything I have learned will be useful in my further musical adventures.
									Final chapter of my clarinet education was my recital in May 2016.
									I thought it would be nice to share some fragments here:

									Francis Poulenc - Clarinet Sonata
								</p>
								<p>
								<audio src="resources/fantasiestuecke.MP3" controls="controls">

								</audio></br>
									Robert Schumann - Fantasiest√ºcke, Op. 73
								</p>
								</br>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="resources/chojazz.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									After obtaining a diploma I did what many clarinet players do, namely picked up the saxophone and started to play jazz.
									I really enjoy learning about jazz harmony. It is a subject somewhere between art and science and I find it very compelling.
									In order to learn more I attended International Jazz Workshops in Chodziez two times during the summer.
								</p>
								</br>
								<p>
									For many years I was playing in a rock band on a bass guitar. My love to rock and metal music persisted and currently my main musical activity is composing and recording in my bedroom.
									This is a solo project that is taking most of my free time. It requires immense efforts

								<h2>Photography</h2>
								<p>
									<br>
									My interest in photography started when I found an old film camera at home.
									I really enjoy film photography because it forces the photographer to think twice before taking a picture.
