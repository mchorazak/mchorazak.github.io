								<h2>Music</h2>
								<p>
								<br>
									Music was a big part of my education, and even when school has finished, it is still a big part of my life, as a hobby. </br>
									I think it's big enough to get a separate paragraph.
                                </p>

									I spent 10 years learning how to play clarinet.
									I did not continue clarinet education but everything I have learned is still useful in my further musical adventures.
									Final chapter of clarinet education was my recital in May 2016.
									I thought it would be nice to share some fragments here:

									After obtaining a diploma I did what many clarinet players do, namely picked up the saxophone and started to play jazz.
									I really enjoy learning about jazz harmony. It is a subject somewhere between art and science and I find it very compelling.
									In order to learn more I attended International Jazz Workshops in Chodziez two times during the summer.
								</p>
								</br>
								<p>
									For many years I was playing in a rock band on a bass guitar. My love to rock and metal music persisted and currently my main musical activity is composing and recording in my bedroom.
									This is a solo project that is taking most of my free time. It requires immense efforts and knowledge of a composer, musician and sound engineer. Most of the projects is still in progress but I can share a little part.

								<h2>Photography</h2>
								<p>
									<br>
									My interest in photography started when I found an old film camera at home.
									I really enjoy film photography because it forces the photographer to think twice before taking a picture.

								<h2>Societies</h2>
								<p>
								<br>
									At the university I belong to few societies and I am on commitee on two of them.
                                </p>

										<h2>Swing Dance Society<br />
										Treasurer, teacher</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        I joined swing dance in my second year.
										I instantly fell in love with dancing and with incredibly strong community stretching across the country.
										I met great people and visited Swing Revolution in Leeds, Whip-ma-whop-ma-hop in York and helped with organising Leicester Leaps In.
										I teach beginners classes and participate in various events as volunteer.
										Most recently I led an introductory lesson in Queniborough community centre, during a charity gig of Syston Big Band.
										Currently I am a Treasurer and Wellbeing and Inclusion Ambassador.

										<h2>Philosophy Society<br />
										Vice-president</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        Since University of Leicester does not have a philosophy department, the society is a group of students more or less loosely interested in philosophical topics.
										We meet once a week and one of the commitee members would introduce everyone to a subject and then lead the discussion.
										Topics vary from classical philosophical dillemas to more contemporary discussions on philosophy of politics and economical systems.
                                    </p>

										<h2>Big band<br />
										Guitar</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        I was a member of the big band as a saxophone player in my first year.
										This year I joined it as a guitar player in order to learn more about harmony and reading jazz notation.
										Big band plays charity gigs, sometimes on a swingaree organised by swing community in the city.
										We recently played in Leicester Prison during Talent Unlocked festival.

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="resources/scouting.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
											Since I was 10 I was a member of a scouting organisation. Initially a scout, then an explorer I trained to become a team leader before I came to England.
                                    		Scouting taught me what is it to be a good person, about teamwork, taught me many skills, manual or not, useful in daily life. It was a great adventure without which I would be a different person.
