								<h2>Music</h2>

								<p>
								<br>
									The current endeavour is the band Lily Pad that I formed with my girlfriend. We write music that I later produce and mix.
									Our music is available on all major streaming platforms:

									Music was always there in one form or another. I spent 10 years learning to play clarinet.
									I did not continue clarinet education but everything I have learned is still useful in my further musical adventures.
									Final chapter of clarinet education was my recital in May 2016:

									After obtaining a diploma I did what many clarinet players do, namely picked up the saxophone and started to play jazz.
									I really enjoy learning about jazz harmony. It is a subject somewhere between art and science and I find it very compelling.
									In order to learn more I attended International Jazz Workshops in Chodziez three times during the summer.
								</p>
								</br>
								<p>
									During my last year at the university I joined the big band as the guitar player.

								<h2>Societies</h2>
								<p>
								<br>
									At the university I belonged to a few societies and I was on a commitee of two of them.
                                </p>

										<h2>Swing Dance Society<br />
										Treasurer, teacher</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        I joined swing dance in my second year.
										I instantly fell in love with dancing and with incredibly strong community stretching across the country.
										I met great people and visited Swing Revolution in Leeds, Whip-ma-whop-ma-hop in York and helped with organising Leicester Leaps In.
										I teach beginners classes and participate in various events as volunteer.
										Most recently I led an introductory lesson in Queniborough community centre, during a charity gig of Syston Big Band.
                                    </p>

										<h2>Philosophy Society<br />
										Vice-president</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        Since University of Leicester does not have a philosophy department, the society is a group of students more or less loosely interested in philosophical topics.
										On weekly meetings one of the commitee members would introduce everyone to a subject and then lead the discussion.
										Topics vary from classical philosophical dillemas to more contemporary discussions on philosophy of politics and economical systems.
                                    </p>

										<h2>Big band<br />
										Guitar</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I joined the University of Leicester Big Band as a guitar player in order to learn more about harmony and reading jazz notation.
										Big band plays charity gigs, sometimes on a swingaree organised by swing community in the city.
