								<h2>Debatable hate speech detection - Master's Thesis</h2>

								<p>
									Having learned a lot about technicalities of machine learning, I decided to take
									even one more step forward in my MSc project and try to answer entirely different
									questions. The European Union together with the big tech companies developed a Code
									of Conduct on Countering Hate Speech Online that companies voluntarily obey. The

									<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/codeofconduct_2020_factsheet_12.pdf">
									5th Evaluation of the Code of Conduct</a> highlights that although percentage
									notifications assesed within 24 hours is steadily rising, most users do not
									receive any feedback or justification as to what decision was taken and why.
									The goal of the project was to create a language classification model that would be
									able to, at least partially, justify decisions to the user.
                                </p>

								<p>
									Using a dataset of sythetically generated tweets two NLP neural networks were built.
									Various preprocessing and encoding methods were tested and, for comparison purposes,
									a long short-term memory and bidirectional neural networks were used. Once sentences
									were classified, the two networks engaged in a debate to determine the outcome.
									The debate was rendered to the screen using natural language so the user can see
									what decisions led to classification.

                                </p>

								<p>
									The framework provided both models with few arguments of statistical nature, for
									example, comparing similarity of a given sentence to training sentences. This can be
									used as	a measure of trustworthiness of a model. The framework, inspired by Kok et
									al. 2011, can be extended in the future

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/mchorazak/kafkacow" >Kafkacow</a></h2>
								<p>
									Kafkacow is a tool I designed, built and tested. It is a good showcase of my code as I
									was the primary developer. Contrary to other projects, this one incorporates many different technologies.
									It is a C++ application that uses Jenkins for CI, Doxygen for documentation.
									It is a tool for reading and pushing messages into a Apache Kafka cluster.
									Contrary to similar existing programs, it supports Flatbuffers serialization.
