								<h2><a href="https://github.com/mchorazak/debatable_hate_speech" >Debatable hate speech detection</a></h2>
								<h2></h2>

								<p>
									Having learned a lot about technicalities of machine learning, I decided to take
									even one more step forward in my MSc project and try to answer entirely different
									questions. The European Union together with the big tech companies developed a Code
									of Conduct on Countering Hate Speech Online that companies voluntarily obey. The

									<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/codeofconduct_2020_factsheet_12.pdf">
									5th Evaluation of the Code of Conduct</a> highlights that although percentage
									notifications assesed within 24 hours is steadily rising, most users do not
									receive any feedback or justification as to what decision was taken and why.
									The goal of the project was to create a language classification model that would be
									able to, at least partially, justify decisions to the user.
                                </p>

								<p>
									Using a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15761">dataset of sythetically generated tweets</a>, two NLP neural networks were built.
									Various preprocessing and encoding methods, like simple BOW or word2vec were tested
									and, for comparison purposes,
									a long short-term memory and bidirectional neural networks were used. I also learned
									experimented with various transfer learning models, including small versions of BERT.
									Once sentences
									were classified, the two networks engaged in a debate to determine the outcome.
									The debate was rendered to the screen using natural language so the user can see
									what decisions led to classification.

                                </p>

								<p>
									The framework provided both models with few arguments of statistical nature, for
									example, comparing similarity of a given sentence to training sentences. This can be
									used as	a measure of trustworthiness of a model. The framework, inspired by Kok et
									al. 2011, can be extended in the future

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/mchorazak/kafkacow" >Kafkacow</a></h2>
								<p>
									Kafkacow is a tool I designed, built and tested. It is a good showcase of my code as I
									was the primary developer, but not the only user.
									Kafkacow is a tool for reading and pushing messages into a Apache Kafka cluster.
									The main difference between it and other existing Kafka consumer/producer programs is that
									it supports Google Flatbuffers serialisation. The data was serialized and deserialised
									on the fly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Contrary to many projects that can be done, for example, at the university,
									this one incorporates many different technologies.
									It is a C++ application using CMake, Jenkins for CI, Doxygen for documentation.
                                </p>

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/mchorazak/venus_volcanoes" >Volcanoes on Venus</a></h2>
								<p>
									This program analyses performance of different machine learning techniques on a
									NASA Magellan dataset. The dataset contains small images of surface of Venus, and
									labels indicating the geological formations in the picture.
								</p>
								<p>
									Using scikit-learn and Tensorflow, program trains a decision
									tree, random forest, logistic regression and three different convolutional neural
									networks. Additionally, it builds ensemble of all CNNs. The program then compares
									different approaches to the problem in forms of graphs.
