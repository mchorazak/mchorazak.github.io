									<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
										I am a machine learning engineer with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence(Merit)
									from the University of St Andrews and BSc in Computing with Management(First) from the University of Leicester.
									I gained professional experience as a developer at Science and Technology Facilities
									Council, ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and while teaching at the university.


									<p><br>
										I have experience with multiple machine learning technologies, such as TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn and NLTK,
										and statistical analysis tools like pandas and numpy.
										Apart from Python, which I taught at the university, I am also proficient with
										C++, which was my first programming language and the one I used the most during my year at STFC.
									</p>

<!--										I am an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of St Andrews.-->
<!--										I am also a Philosophy student at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, my home city.-->
<!--										Over the last two years I became interested in combining these two subjects, within the field of ethical AI.-->
<!--										During the final project in the third term I will investigate explainable AI in ethically ambiguous problems.-->

<!--                                        After returning to Leicester, in my last year, I was asked to work as a teaching assistant beside studying.-->
