									<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
										I am a machine learning graduate with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence(Merit)
									from the University of St Andrews and BSc in Computing with Management(First) from the University of Leicester.
									I gained professional programming experience as a developer at ISIS Neutron and Muon Source of Science and Technology Facilities
									Council and while teaching at the University of Leicester.

								</header>
									<p>
										I have experience with multiple machine learning technologies, such as TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn and NLTK,
										as well as statistical analysis tools like pandas and numpy.
										Apart from Python, which I usually use for machine learning projects, I am also proficient with
										Objective C++, which was my first programming language and which, beside Python, I used heavily during
										my professional time at ISIS.

									</p>

									<p>
										I learned to be a part of a multi national team with great code development practices,
										extensive git collaboration, stand-up meetings(oftentimes remote) and continuous integration.
										I also learned to communicate my ideas clearly, what got me a job at academic teaching.
									</p>

									<p>
										Over time I realised that what gives me the biggest satisfaction is asking
										difficult, perhaps unobvious questions and seeking answers. Constant element
										of research is why I chose artificial intelligence in the first place, so I stay
										up to date with AI news, including some academic works, like Minds and Machines.
