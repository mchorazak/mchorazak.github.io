                                    I spent my industrial placement year at Science and Technology Facilities Council in south Oxfordshire.
									I was a Data Streaming Developer in a multinational team consisting of scientists from UK, Switzerland and Sweden.
									We were working on a data pipeline for the European Spallation Source, the biggest neutron spallation source in the world, currently under construction in Sweden.
									The software will be eventually used also by STFC and Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland.

									It was a great year and I am confident it was the best placement I could have got.

									<p>At the university I study a course which, in addition to computer science modules teaches also basics of economy and project management.
                                        The course is heavily focused on computer science with around a quarter of credits being from modules lead by the School of Business.
                                        It is a blend of programming and computer science knowledge with essays and critical evaluation of different business concepts.
                                        It shaped me as a programmer and enriched me as a person in many ways.

                                        In Gymnasium I learned a lot about many different subjects.
                                        This included early adventures with programing in Delphi.
                                        I become interested in sciences and decided to apply to a high school that focus on these subjects.
