									<h1>Experience</h1>
									<p>I try to take every opportunity for gaining experience and earning my own money.</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									As a teenager, during holidays I would work at Pepco Poland in the HR department helping with documentation or searching for medical contractors for Occupational Health and Safety for the company's shops around the country.
									Next year I spent my summer working in a factory producing bottle closures.
									This way I earned some money needed for my first year of studies.
									During my second year I was working part-time at Poundland, trying to divide my time between work and studying.
                                </p>

								<p>
									At that time I also applied for an industrial placement at Science and Technology Facilities Council.
									STFC recruits very early in the year so by December, when most of my friends started to think about applying, I already secured my place.
                                    I spent next year at a cutting-edge ISIS Neutron Spallation Source in south Oxfordhire.
									I was a Data Streaming Developer in a multinational team consisting of scientists from UK, Switzerland and Sweden.
									We were working on a data pipeline for the European Spallation Source, the biggest neutron spallation source in the world, currently under construction in Sweden.
									The software will be eventually used to collect, store and process experiments data also by ISIS and Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland.
                                </p>
								<p>
									It was a great year and I am confident it was the best placement I could have got.
									I learned a lot of things that are not explicitly taught at the university.
									Creating parts of a big system that uses multiple technologies interacting with each other was a big challange.
									My thinking about difficult tasks changed, and it is this change of attitude that makes my third year of studies so much different than the previous two.
									Among many things, I created a program that helped the team with debugging the streaming system.
									It was the biggest program I ever wrote and I consider it to be my greatest programing achievement.
									I also contributed to many other parts of the system, all of which can be viewed at ESS-DMSC github.
								</p>
								<p>
									Upon return to the university I became a Teaching Assistant on one of the second-year modules, Operating Systems.
									From my first year I was hoping this could be my student job at some point.
									I find it really enjoyable, rewarding and I still learn a lot myself.
									During weekly lab sessions I help students with problems they might encounter while solving the lab assignments.
									I explain concepts presented during lectures or help with revisions.
									This requires quick analysis and good understanding of the topic.
									I think knowledge from modules I have previously taken and the fluency of analysing problems I got during my placement help me in being a helpful TA.

                                    I went to ACCU Conference, where C++ programmers meet for sessions and discussions.
                                    I was very surprised to find how strong a community behind a programming language can be.
                                    Sessions were mostly on C++, new language features, libraries and interesting applications but also on difficulties of implementing a units library, optimising with assembly or soft skills.
                                    I won a book by Ivan Cukic and I will definitely attend next conference.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I also went to Oxford to attend The 12th Congress of Polish Students in the UK.
                                    It is an annual conference where polish students can meet each other, employers and politicians to discuss future of both UK and Poland.
                                    This means panels on political, economical and social issues.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I participated in Hacktoberfest organised by DigitalOcean.
                                    It is an action that promotes open source software and is building community around it.
                                    I practice programming and algorithmic thinking on <a href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/8e0158ae251bdcd290758240c778e92e1216211">Codingame</a>.

										In order to fund my second year of studies I was working at Poundland.
										It was a part-time job, occupying most of my time during weekends and few hours during the week.
