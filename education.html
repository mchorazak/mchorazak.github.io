									<h1>Education</h1>
									<p>Over the years I attended different schools in my home city to eventually come for my studies in the United Kingdom.</p>
								</header>
								<p>Years indicated by below overlap because for the most of my life I was a student in two schools at the same time - general education school and music school.
                                    In Poland in order to learn music and obtain qualification one has to attend a school dedicated to teaching music.
                                    It is split into two stages, usually 4+6 years.
                                    This means lessons of mathematics, English, physics etc. during the day, and lessons of harmony, instruments, aural training and music history in the evening.
                                    On top of that any homework and daily instrument practice. There were many days when I would leave home at 7 am and come back after 8 pm having 10 hours of lessons.
                                </p>
								<p>
                                    In gymnasium I was introduced to programming in Delphi.
                                    In high school I started my programming adventure with C++. I enjoyed it a lot and decided to change my focus from physics to computer science and took it on my Matura exams.
									Matura is a test taken at the end of high school, an equivalent of A-levels, although from long talks with British students I know it is difficult to compare the two reliably.
									Apart from various compulsory tests in mathematics and Polish language, students have to choose at least one subject to take on extended level.
									I took extended computer science, mathematics and English language.
								</p>
								<p>
									After finishing the music school and obtaining a diploma I moved to England to study at the University of Leicester.
                                    I really enjoy every moment spent at the university. This includes lectures, studying in the library or in the computer lab, and societies.
                                    My third year is filled with research done on my own.
                                    This is mainly due to my final year project which involves machine learning.
                                    I aim to create a system for analysing data from NASA Magellan mission.
                                    In early 1990s NASA sent the Magellan probe to map the surface of Venus.
                                    Part of the pictures was labeled depending on geological formations that the image contains and the set was made available to the public.
                                    Apart from creating the system I will implement some of the back-end functionality myself in order to understand how machine learning works internally.

									<p>At the university I study a course which, in addition to computer science modules teaches also basics of economy and project management.
                                        The course is heavily focused on computer science with around a quarter of credits being from modules lead by the School of Business.
                                        It is a blend of programming and computer science knowledge with essays and critical evaluation of different business concepts.
                                        It shaped me as a programmer and enriched me as a person in many ways.

                                        After initial four years I continued my musical education mastering clarinet. Other subjects included for example piano, aural training, music harmony.
                                        It was a great challenge and, apart from music, taught me a lot of self-determination, organising my own time and shifted dramatically my understanding of being busy.

                                        In Gymnasium I learned a lot about many different subjects.
                                        This included early adventures with programing in Delphi.
                                        I become interested in sciences and decided to apply to a high school that focus on these subjects.
