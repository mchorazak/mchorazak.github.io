									<p>
										A year-long Masters degree in artificial intelligence involved theoretical, mathematical background and programming practice.
										The course consisted of modules on AI theory and philosophy, and courses on practical AI and machine learning.
										I learned audio and video processing, and natural language processing with grammars.
										I reinforced my knowledge of deep learning and statistics.
										In my MSc dissertation I built a framework for debatable AI with the aim of explaining and justifying system's decisions to the user.

										While studying at St Andrews I took advantage of the pandemic and remote learning, and enrolled simultaneously on a course in philosophy.
										Logic, ethics and philosophy of language and linguistics are actually pretty relevant to my primary field of interest.

										In addition, modules on human rights and naturalistic epistemology as basis of science, or various contemporary societal issues are useful for any person.

										<h2>University of Leicester<br /></br>
										BSc Computing with Management</h2>

									<a href="https://le.ac.uk/" class="image fit"><img src="resources/UoL.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> My three year undergraduate course showed me large variety of technologies from simple Java
										and Python programming, through web applications through artificial intelligence.
										Beside, the course provided me with solid theoretical understanding of mathematics, algorithm design or workings of
										an operating system. It also included project management, information visualisation and business side of computation.
									</br>
										My dissertation was in machine learning and recognizing geological formation on the surface of Venus.
										At that point I was largely a self taught machine learning engineer.
										Most of the work I did was outside the scope of teaching and required a lot of effort.
										<a href="https://le.ac.uk/informatics/study/undergraduate/prizes/prize-winners">This was recognized by the department as the project was chosen the best project in the course.</a>

										Clarinet</a></h2>

									<p>
                                        I spent 10 years in music education mastering clarinet in parallel to general education schools like high school. Other subjects included for example piano, aural training, music harmony.
                                        It was a great challenge and, apart from music, taught me a lot of self-determination, organising my own time and shifted dramatically my understanding of being busy.
